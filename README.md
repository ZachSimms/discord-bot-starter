## About

This repository contains the starting code for my discord bots based on a tutorial I followed [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpmb-7WxPhe0ZVpH9pxT5MtC4heqej8Es&si=rS6AJH0gYvrc0VYe). There are random comments sprinkled throught to help me recall the functionalities of sections
<br />
Please note that this is not the best starter code for making a discord bot with Discord.JS, but it's good enough for me at the moment.

```
{
    "testServer": "123",
    "clientId": "123",
    "devs": [
        "123",

## Add Commands

Example commands are given in the starter code in `/src/commands`

<strong>Steps</strong>
1. Go to the `src/commands` folder and add your command file into an appropriate nested folder OR make your own nested folder and put your command file into it
2. Follow the same formatting as provided in the examples `ping.js` and `ban.js`
3. run `nodemon` in the terminal
4. Good Luck ðŸ˜Ž


Example code for `src/commands/misc/helloworld.js`

```
module.exports = {
    name: 'helloworld',
    description: 'Classic Hello world',
    devOnly: false,

    callback: (client, interaction) => {
        interaction.reply({
          content: `Hello World! User: ${interaction.user.globalName}`,
          ephemeral: true,
        })
    },
};
```
